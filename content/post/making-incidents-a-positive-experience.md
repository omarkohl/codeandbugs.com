Today I attended a wonderful talk at the WeAreDevelopers conference in Berlin.

After discussing it with my colleague and mulling it over while walking around Berlin these are my thoughts. The important insights are all stolen from @malinlitwkinski's talk.

When an incident happens or when we find the cause for it we immediately suffer from hindsight bias so it's clear who/what was to blame. It becomes "obvious" that it's something we could have avoided. But actually it's not true. We could not have avoided it because otherwise we would have. We always do our very best and there is no point in lamenting about the past and what "should" have happened. Rather accept reality and look towards the future how to improve things.

Incidents are suprises.

Another key insight is that we all like solving puzzles, that's why we work in IT. What we do not like is stress. What is the difference between being in the center of a room filled with people, you at the center, defusing a bomb that will go off in a few minutes and an escape room simulating precisely that scenario? The framing. In one case we feel intensly under pressure and that impacts our performance.

We should aim to reframe incidents as positives experiences. As challenges where we calmly collaborate in a treasure hunt for the solution.

Do not work alone, do not feel alone. Do the on-call duty in pairs.

Host periodic chaos exercises where you practice collaborating as a team to find a solution.

Work with your team and you management to convert even the most severe customer incident into a joyful experience.

Currently I find that incidents are seriously impacting my performance. I struggle enjoying my job. I feel paralyzed and powerless and just wish the issue would go away so I could do the things I wanted to do.

I'm convinced that the long term effects of making incidents something positive are better team performance and faster issue resolution. But I also suspect that even the issue at hand, the one that is keeping you busy until late into the night will get resolved faster this way.

Clearly separate the important things in your life from the other things.
