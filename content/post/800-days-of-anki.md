Can you say you have really lived unless the first question you answered in the morning was what the capital of Belize is? And then, how to say "The people are drinking champagne" in French?

That already essentially sums up Anki. It's a piece of software that asks you questions and then displays the result. You yourself then grade how good your answer was.

Sound simple, if not trivial, right? So what is the big deal?

Let's start with human memory. It isn't very good. It's continously discarding information it once collected. Which is really frustrating if you ever try to recall "What DID I learn all those years ago in college?".

The forgetting curve was first proposed by Ebbinghaus who experimented on himself, memorizing random sylables and measured how long it took him to forget them.

Anki, and other so called SRS (spaced repetition software) rest on two key principles:

* Spaced repetition: Repeating information you want to remember at certain intervals
* Active recall: Instead of passively ingesting (re-reading some text fragment) you are ASKED and need to produce an ANSWER

The interesting thing about spaced repetition is that it not only decreases the number of times you have to repeat a certain piece of information but that fewer repetitions (if timed correctly) actually increase the strength (durability) of those memories! A good old win-win!

Fundamental Anki rules:

* Don't tinker, but get started!
* Make good cards
* Improve incrementally


Other lessons:
* Don't give up. It's a hard habit to make and it takes many people several attempts to get started. For me it was the third attempt in three years that made it stick. Between attempts I didn't touch Anki.
* Monitor you feelings and interests and get rid of cards and subjects that make you dread your reviews
* Add variety
* Add priority so you can review less when you don't have the time or energy to do everything
* Use a Bluetooth keyboard when on your phone

Examples from my collection.

And in case you were wondering, the capital of Belize (a small country in Central America, right next to Guatemala) is Belmopan and on your next New Year's Eve in Paris you can confidently proclaim: "Les gens boivent du champagne!".
